            I am a <span class="bold">host</span> at heart. It has always been my goal to make anyone
            around me as comfortable as possible and feel like we are old
            friends regardless of how long I've known them. <span class="bold">Technology</span> has
            always been a passion of mine from a young age. The wonderment of
            how the devices we use can do so much in a so seemingly simple
            fashion is remarkable. As a <span class="bold">Web Developer</span>, I get to marry these two
            <span class="bold">passions</span> by creating inviting, easy-to-use applications that put the
            user at ease with their intuitiveness.
