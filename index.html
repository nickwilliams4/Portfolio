            I am a host at heart. It has always been my goal to make anyone
            around me as comfortable as possible and feel like we are old
            friends regardless of how long I've known them. Technology has
            always been a passion of mine from a young age. The wonderment of
            how the devices we use can do so much in a so seemingly simple
            fashion is remarkable. As a web developer, I get to marry these two
            passions by creating inviting, easy-to-use applications that put the
            user at ease with their intuitiveness.
